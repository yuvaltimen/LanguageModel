<s> The old woman stood facing him in silence and looking inquiringly at him </s>
<s> Is that serious </s>
<s> Taking a new step uttering a new word is what they fear most </s>
<s> and can I can I possibly No it’s nonsense it’s rubbish he added resolutely </s>
<s> That’s a good thing anyway he thought to himself as he rang the bell of the old woman’s flat </s>
<s> It’s simply physical derangement </s>
<s> He knew that the flat had been occupied by a German clerk in the civil service and his family </s>
<s> There was not a speck of dust to be seen in the whole flat </s>
<s> Why it’s just such trifles that always ruin everything </s>
<s> Why am I going there now </s>
<s> The bell gave a faint tinkle as though it were made of tin and not of copper </s>
<s> The old woman coughed and groaned at every instant </s>
<s> A rouble and a half and interest in advance if you like </s>
<s> But there was nothing special in the room </s>
<s> Their departure left the room quiet and rather empty </s><s> He had successfully avoided meeting his landlady on the staircase </s>
<s> Hm yes all is in a man’s hands and he lets it all slip from cowardice that’s an axiom </s>
<s> Goodday Alyona Ivanovna </s>
<s> This confusion became more and more intense </s>
<s> What business is she of yours my good sir </s>
<s> That makes thirtyfive copecks altogether </s>
<s> He started his nerves were terribly overstrained by now </s>
<s> It is not serious at all </s>
<s> Hand it over he said roughly </s>
<s> Yes my hat is too noticeable </s>
<s> I shall be getting some money soon </s>
<s> When he was in the street he cried out Oh God how loathsome it all is </s>
<s> It would be interesting to know what it is men are most afraid of </s>
<s> So she carries the keys in a pocket on the right </s>
<s> He was crushed by poverty but the anxieties of his position had of late ceased to weigh upon him </s>
<s> All that’s nonsense he said hopefully and there is nothing in it all to worry about </s>
<s> I want to attempt a thing like that and am frightened by these trifles he thought with an odd smile </s><s> There his progress was barred by some porters who were engaged in moving furniture out of a flat </s>
<s> You come with such trifles my good sir it’s scarcely worth anything </s>
<s> It’s because I chatter that I do nothing </s>
<s> The old woman came back </s>
<s> The young man left standing alone in the middle of the room listened inquisitively thinking </s>
<s> Her colourless somewhat grizzled hair was thickly smeared with oil and she wore no kerchief over it </s>
<s> In that quarter of the town however scarcely any shortcoming in dress would have created surprise </s>
<s> He longed for a drink of cold beer and attributed his sudden weakness to the want of food </s>
<s> What filthy things my heart is capable of </s>
<s> I knew it he muttered in confusion I thought so </s>
<s> At once he felt easier and his thoughts became clear </s>
<s> Lizaveta’s work thought the young man </s>
<s> Phew how utterly petty it all is </s>
<s> He was hopelessly in debt to his landlady and was afraid of meeting her </s>
<s> Here it is </s>
<s> Without stopping to think Raskolnikov went down the steps at once </s>
<s> And here </s>
<s> And each time he passed the young man had a sick frightened feeling which made him scowl and feel ashamed </s>
<s> There was a continual coming and going through the two gates and in the two courtyards of the house </s>
<s> An expression of the profoundest disgust gleamed for a moment in the young man’s refined face </s>
<s> The old woman fumbled in her pocket for her keys and disappeared behind the curtain into the other room </s>
<s> These two rooms made up the whole flat </s>
<s> Please yourself—and the old woman handed him back the watch </s>
<s> How much will you give me for the watch Alyona Ivanovna </s>
<s> He asked her as casually as possible as he went out into the passage </s>
<s> Strongboxes always have keys like that but how degrading it all is </s>
<s> His garret was under the roof of a high fivestoried house and was more like a cupboard than a room </s>
<s> Yes maybe it is a plaything <s>
<s> For this business one should be as little conspicuous as possible Trifles trifles are what matter </s>
<s> But the time is up for your last pledge </s>
<s> The month was up the day before yesterday </s>
<s> This evening however on coming out into the street he became acutely aware of his fears </s>
<s> You are too quick </s>>
<s> It’s simply a fantasy to amuse myself a plaything </s>
<s> There were few people at the time in the tavern </s>
<s> And how could such an atrocious thing come into my head </s>
<s> He had given up attending to matters of practical importance he had lost all desire to do so </s>
<s> But seeing a number of people on the landing she grew bolder and opened the door wide </s>
<s> Oh nothing particular I simply asked </s>
<s> But I am talking too much </s>
<s> Step in my good sir </s>
<s>Goodbye are you always at home alone your sister is not here with you </s>
<s> A rouble and a half cried the young man </s>
<s> So I must give you a rouble and fifteen copecks for the watch </s>
<s> Why a stupid thing like this the most trivial detail might spoil the whole plan </s>
<s> He had counted them once when he had been lost in dreams </s>
<s> Raskolnikov went out in complete confusion </s>
<s> I will bring you the interest for another month wait a little </s>
<s> Am I capable of that </s>
<s> Nothing that any landlady could do had a real terror for him </s>
<s> Everything was very clean the floor and the furniture were brightly polished everything shone </s>
<s> I am again on the same errand Raskolnikov continued a little disconcerted and surprised at the old woman’s mistrust </s>
<s> Or perhaps it is that I chatter because I do nothing </s>
<s> The young man did not dispute it and took the money </s>
<s> The little flats in such houses always have bells that ring like that </s>
<s> She was a diminutive withered up old woman of sixty with sharp malignant eyes and a sharp little nose </s>
<s> Three or four doorkeepers were employed on the building </s>
<s> What </s>
<s> The young man stepped into the dark entry which was partitioned off from the tiny kitchen </s>
<s> In the corner a light was burning before a small ikon </s>
<s> Well we will talk about it then sir </s>
<s> only a rouble and fifteen copecks now </s>
<s> That’s the worst of all </s>
<s> It must be the top drawer he reflected </s>
<s> He could hear her unlocking the chest of drawers </s>
<s> I’ve learned to chatter this last month lying for days together in my den thinking of Jack the Giantkiller </s>
<s> Give me four roubles for it I shall redeem it it was my father’s </s>
<s> Just so </s>
<s> Not shame however but quite another feeling akin to terror had overtaken him </s>
<s> I am sure that we shall see each other again very soon <s>
